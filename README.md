# Procedural World Generation
### Visualized in the terminal using my own graphics library DisplayLib
### The algorithm is self-crafted, and I have named it `"The Hummy Algorithm"`
---
## Controls:
- " " SPACEBAR: generate from the same parameters
- "." (DOT): generate from randomized parameters
- "," (COMMA): save the generated map as "map.txt" (Available when all the workers have died out)

## Regarding "static_builder.py"
It is basically a near instant version of the main script. Its parameters have to be changed manually in source code
